# Learning-Paths

This is an alternative frontend for [Tinkerhub-Learning-Paths](https://github.com/tinkerhub/TinkerHub-Learning-Paths)
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/1a842584-b2c2-4c03-bcff-0e3c0d8477a0/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/new-learning-paths/deploys)

### Why?

The official project is adding lot of bloatware to the code. this project will focus on delivering the content of the learning paths alone with improved speed.

### Why is this not a direct fork?

The only thing we are pulling from upstream is the content, i think that's enough justification to not make this a fork

### How will this project be maintained?

As long as there is no license changes from tinkerhub we will continue to migrate learning paths from upstream to this theme

However i have decided to leave out some paths and may continue to do this if they appear low effort in my personal discretion

### Will there be new content?

I cannot promise anything, but i might add new paths and modify existing ones if i have enough time to do so.

### Who is this for?

This project is not intended to replace the original site, i just wanted to browse learning paths without the bloatware, if that's something you care about you can use this.

### Why remove the tinkerhub branding?

- Because it adds no value to the content
- I'm not a fan of the tinkerhub mission :) (despite this TLP is a good project that's why i still support it)
